    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>This is a conference aggregation and analysis project on Azure prepared as part of the George Washington University Data Science Masters Program. This project seeks to address multiple challenges associated with finding, aggregating and analyzing conferences. This project also seeks to help visualize trends in technology and security conferences and identify potentially disruptive technologies.
    </p>
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>The pace of technological change has become an organizational challenge itself. Ray Kurzweil argued that with the rate of technology acceleration we see now, we will experience 20,000 years of progress in the 21st century as opposed to 100 years (Alier, 2017). Today we see technology disruption from Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Systems and Distributed Ledger technologies (Panetta, 2019). What this means is that organizations need to be adaptable to potentially disruptive technology in order to remain successful. Research studies and the market have borne out that companies that are open the opportunities and disruption of technology are ultimately more successful (Birkinshaw, 2018). 
    </p>
    <p>Effective responses involve multiple steps including building awareness, capacity and scaling for technology adoption (Birkinshaw, 2018).  While in the past, traditional investment approaches towards technology forecasting would have been effective or at least adequate for achieving awareness of potential disruptive technologies, this may no longer be the case with the rate of change. However, data science and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AL) may offer solutions to mitigate the deluge of new technologies and help determine impact and scale of changes faced by organizations.
    </p>
    <p>The goal of this project will be to demonstrate and evaluate end-to-end techniques that can be used find disruptive technology topics using data/text mining, natural language processing (NLP), cloud computing and data visualization. It will rely primarily on Python data mining libraries and web scraping tools such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup; machine learning / deep learning frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow; and visualization libraries and web frameworks including Seaborn, Plotly, Flask and Bootstrap HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h3>Conference Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Numerous conferences to keep track of</li>
      <li>Difficulty tracking conference dates and locations</li>
      <li>Low density topic conferences that are harder to find</li>
      <li>Emerging and disruptive technologies</li>
      <li>Challenge identifying low cost or local events</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <p>The project is presented in the form of an interactive <a href="../">HTML page</a> using Python Flask, Bootstrap, CSS, client-side JavaScript such as JQuery, D3.js, Leaflet, DataTable and other applicable visualization libraries. It also leveraged a custom scraping and retrieval framework with Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium and the Requests library for retrieval and processing. Source code management leveraged GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
    </p>
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>This project leveraged Azure infrastructure for multiple elements, including the main backend database architecture, which used <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/">Cosmos DB</a>. Cosmos DB is a multi-modal NoSQL database as a service (DBaaS) which allows for rapid prototyping of new datastructures and quick secure integration with other systems. For the hosting and integration of the Python Flask, we used <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/">Azure Web Apps</a> which is a fully-managed web hosting platform supporting continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), application monitoring and metrics.
